//5.21 (Pythagorean Triples) A right triangle can have sides whose lengths are all integers. The set
//        of three integer values for the lengths of the sides of a right triangle is called a Pythagorean triple.
//        The lengths of the three sides must satisfy the relationship that the sum of the squares of two of the
//        sides is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. Write an application that displays a table of the
//        Pythagorean triples for side1 , side2 and the hypotenuse , all no larger than 500. Use a triple-nested
//        for loop that tries all possibilities. This method is an example of “brute-force” computing. You’ll
//        learn in more advanced computer-science courses that for many interesting problems there’s no
//        known algorithmic approach other than using sheer brute force.
