//6.27 (The Greatest Common Divisor) The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers is the largest
//        integer that evenly divides each of the two numbers. Write a method gcd that returns the greatest
//        common divisor of two integers. [Hint: You might want to use Euclid’s algorithm. You can find
//        information about it at en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm .] Incorporate the method
//        into an application that reads two values from the user and displays the result.
